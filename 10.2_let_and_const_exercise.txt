Quiz
1. What is the difference between var and let?
One of the main differences between var and let is that var has a function scope where as let has a block scope. 
Variables declared with let only exist between curly brackets, block scope. Another difference is that var can be redeclared
where as a variable under let cannot be redeclared. This allows for the var variable to have a global and local
scope. 

2. What is the difference between var and const?
Unlike a var, const cannot be be reassigned as a const designates a variable to be constantly that initial assignment.
A const can also not be redeclared like a let. A const also has block scope unlike a var. 

3. What is the difference between let and const?
The main difference between a let and a const is that a let can be reassigned whereas a const cannot be reassigned.

4. What is hoisting?
Hoisting is when the variable declaration is executed first when the script is ran. This is something of a benefit for 
var where as let and const do not have the declaration executed first.
